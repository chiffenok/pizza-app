# pizza-app

to run both backend and frontend

´npm run dev´

### Improvements 
* Create a form to add different types of pizzas
* Create a separate collection for like activities where keep userId, pizzaId, timestamp and amount of likes
* Display more statistics f.e. which pizza are most liked
* Continue developing unit testing

Unfortunately, I haven't had enough free time during this week to implement all my ideas.
